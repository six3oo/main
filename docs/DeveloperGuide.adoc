By: `Team T15-B1`      Since: `Sep 2017`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `LockScreen` which contains `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::lock[]
=== Lock Screen
The Lock Screen loads first before the Main Window. The status and logic of unlocking the application resides inside `LogicManager`.

`LogicManager` contains boolean variable `isLock` to keep track of the application's lock status.
Assuming that there is a password set in the preference file, on launch `isLock` will be set to `true`, and the `LockScreen` will be loaded onto the `Stage`.

[NOTE]
If there is not password set in the preference file `isLock` will be set to false and the `LockScreen` will not be loaded onto the `Stage`.

Upon entering a password, the entered password will be checked using the `isPassword` method which resides in `LogicManager`.
`isPassword` method then calls the `checkPassword` method inside `UserPrefs` as  `UserPrefs` reads the password from the preference file.
The entered password is converted to a MD5 hash string using `convertToMD5` method inside `UserPrefs` before comparing the passwords.
Similarly, a password will be converted to MD5 hash string before storing in the preference file.

In order to change the password, a new command `changepwd` is implemented.
----
changepwd NEW_PASSWORD OLD_PASSWORD
----

[NOTE]
Suppose that the user uses the application for the first time, there will be no password set in the preference file.
Using the same `changepwd` command the user can set the password by leaving the [old_password] field empty.

Upon successful unlocking of the application, the lock screen will call `loadMainWindow()` which creates a new `MainWindow` and loads it into the `Stage`, replacing the existing `LockScreen`.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of LockScreen +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a `LockScreen` class to display the lock screen. +
**Pros:** Easy to create a custom lock screen window with its own elements. Height, width and elements inside the lock screen window (e.g. password field) can be set isolated from the `MainWindow`. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +

**Alternative 2:** Create a lock screen stackpane inside the `MainWndow` class. +
**Pros:** Do not need to create a entire class. +
**Cons:** Elements in the main window have to be hardcoded to appear or disappear when necessary. For example, the password field have to be removed after login and the other main window elements (e.g. CommandBox) have to appear. +
There will also be restrictions to the arrangement of the elements as the FXML placeholder have to be initialised despite not being used. For example, the CommandBoxPlaceholder have to be initialised in the lock screen despite not being used.
// end::lock[]

// tag::FindEmailCommand[]
=== FindEmailCommand
This enhancement is aiming to make the searches more powerful. +
To find a person on the AddressBook, user is no longer restricted to just name search. User can now search for a person using Email. +
To use this command, user just need to type in `“findemail”` follow by a white space, and typing in the email of the person the user is trying to find. +

The implementation of the find email command consist of 3 new classes, namely `FindEmailCommand.java`, `EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate.java` and `FindEmailCommandParser.java.` `FindEmailCommand.java` and `FindEmailCommandParser.java` resides in the logic component, while `EmailsContainKeywordsPredicate.java` resides in the model component. +

image::FindEmailDiagram.png[width="800"]
Figure 3.2.1 +

**Functions of classes in FindEmailCommand** +

**1)**	FindEmailCommand.java: This class searches and lists the persons in address book whose email contains any of the argument keyword. This class extends the abstract class Command. +

**2)**	EmailContainsKeyWordsPredicate.java: This class tests that a person’s email matches any of the keyword given. This class implements Predicate<ReadOnlyPerson> interface. +

**3)**	FindEmailCommandParser.java: This class parses input arguments and creates a new FindEmailCommand object. +

**Implementations of Find Email Command** +
The `FindEmailCommand` are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class FindEmailCommand extends Command{
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
	//command logic
    }
}
----

The `EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate.java` class is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate implements Predicate<ReadOnlyPerson> {
    @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        //test logic
    }

----

Lastly, the `FindEmailCommandParser.java` is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class FindEmailCommandParser {

    public FindEmailCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        //parser logic
    }
}
----
// end::FindEmailCommand[]

// tag::FavCommand[]
=== FavCommand
This enhancement allows users to add or remove people to and fro a favourites list. +
To use this command, users just need to type in `fave <index of targeted person> <true/false>`. +
`true` will add the targeted person to the favourites, while `false` removes the person. +
The favourites state is a boolean variable saved in the addressbook.xml file. +
The implementation of the fave command consists of 2 new classes, namely `FavCommand.java`, `FavCommandParser.java.` +
Both these classes reside in the Logic component.

image:FavCommand.png[width=800] +
Figure 3.3.1 +

**Functions of classes in FavCommand** +

**1)**	FavCommand.java: This class sets the `favourite` boolean variable in a target `Person` as either `true` or `false`. This class extends the abstract class UndoableCommand. +

**2)**	FavCommandParser.java: This class parses input arguments and creates a new FavCommand object. +

**Implementations of FavCommand** +
The `FavCommand` is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class FavCommand extends Command{
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
	//command logic
    }
}

----

The `FavCommandParser.java` is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class FavCommandParser {

    public FindEmailCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        //parser logic
    }
}
----
// end::FavCommand[]
// tag::FindFavCommand[]
=== FindFavCommand
This enhancement allows users to view the favourites list. +
To use this command, users just need to type in `findfav` or `ffav`. +
The implementation of the fave command consists of 3 new classes, namely `FindFavCommand.java`, `FindFavCommandParser.java` and `FavouritePredicate.java`. +
The first two class reside in the Logic component, and the latter class resides in the Model component.

**Functions of classes in FindFavCommand** +

**1)**	FavCommand.java: This class searches and lists the persons in address book who are marked as favourites. This class extends the abstract class Command.

**2)**	FavouritePredicate.java: This class tests that a person is marked as a favourite. This class implements Predicate<ReadOnlyPerson> interface. +

**3)**	FindEmailCommandParser.java: This class parses input arguments and creates a new FindFavCommand object. +

**Implementations of FindFavCommand**

The `FindFavCommand` is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class FindFavCommand extends Command{
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
	//command logic
    }
}

----

The `FindFavCommandParser.java` is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class FindFavCommandParser {

    public FindEmailCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        //parser logic
    }
}
----
The `FavouritePredicate.java` is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class FavouritePredicate extends Predicate<ReadOnlyPerson> {

    @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson) {
        //predicate logic
    }
}
----

// end::FindFavCommand[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::selectcommand[]
=== Select command

The select command opens up the selected contact's profile GUI, which is implemented in the `ProfilePanel.java` class. This command makes use of the YouTube Data API to retrieve information from the YouTube servers.

The method `handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent()` listens for the event triggered by the select command and passes the person object of the selected contact to the `loadPersonProfile()` method.

----
@Subscribe
private void handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent(PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent event) throws IOException {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    loadPersonPage(event.getNewSelection().person);
}
----

With the person object, `YouTubeAuthorizer.getYouTubeChannel()` is called with the channel ID of the person and the needed channel resources as arguments.

----
String personChannelId = person.getChannelId().toString();

assert personChannelId != null : "personChannelId should not be null";
channel = YouTubeAuthorizer.getYouTubeChannel(person.getChannelId().toString(), "statistics,snippet");
----

==== Dynamic information:
link:#dynamic-information[Dynamic information] is information retrieved from the YouTube servers every time the user views the profile of the contact. In the list below, the channel resource associated with the category of dynamic information is put in brackets.

*Categories included in current version:*

. Channel title (snippet)
. Channel thumbnail (snippet)
. Channel description (snippet)
. Subscriber count (statistics)
. Total view count (statistics)
. Video count (statistics)

Some of the dynamic information, such as view count, grabbed from the YouTube Servers are difficult to read due to the long chain of digits that each category might be presented in (eg. 191929603). +

To tackle this problem, the `formatNumber()` method is implemented to reduce the number of digits with the order of magnitude suffix placed behind the simplified number. The result from formatting the number '191929603' can be seen in the views categories in Figure 3.5.2.1 below. +

Currently the `formatNumber()` method supports up to the billion suffix. Suffix representing larger order of magnitudes will be added when the need arises.

----
private String formatNumber(long number) {
    final long thousand = 1000L;
    final long million = 1000000L;
    final long billion = 1000000000L;

    if (number >= billion) {
        return String.format("%.1f%c", (double) number / billion, 'b');
    } else if (number >= million) {
        return String.format("%.1f%c", (double) number / million, 'm');
    } else if (number >= thousand) {
        return String.format("%.1f%c", (double) number / thousand, 'k');
    } else {
        return number + "";
    }
}
----

==== Profile GUI
Displayed in the profile are the dynamic information about the channel, that the contact is affiliated with, as stated above. (Figure 3.6.2.1). +


image::profile_ui.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3.6.2.1 : Graphical User interface for profile_



==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** The usage of YouTuber channel ID or username to retrieve channel information. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use YouTube channel ID. +
**Pros:** There is a unique ID for each YouTube channel. +
**Cons:** User would need to copy and paste the uniquely generated channel ID as it would be very inconvenient to type in each individual character. +
**Alternative 2:** Use YouTube Username. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user and easier to type in. +
**Cons:** There are so many channels with the same highly sought after names (sans the bigger channels). Although it will be easier for the user to type in as most channel names are easy to read, the user might confuse the channel title with the channel username (both are often mistaken as the same thing), resulting in the wrong channel being saved. +
// end::selectcommand[]


=== Favourites mechanism

The Favourites mechanism is facilitated by a 'favourite' boolean variable, which resides inside `Person`. It flags each 'Person' object as either a favourite, or not one.

----
public class FavCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        try {
            model.favPerson(personToFave, status);
            } catch (DuplicatePersonException dpe) {
                assert false : "The target person cannot be already in the favourites list";
            } catch (PersonNotFoundException pnfe) {
                assert false : "The target person cannot be found";
            }

        if (status == true){
            return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_FAVE_PERSON_SUCCESS, personToFave));
        }

        else {
            return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_UNFAVE_PERSON_SUCCESS, personToFave));
        }

    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application for the first time. All 'Person' models will have 'false' as their 'favourite' boolean variable..

The user executes a new `FavCommand`, `1 true`, to mark the first person on the displayed list as a favourite. Should he then execute 'fave 1 false', that first person will no longer be marked as a favourite.

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, the person's 'favourite' boolean variable will not change.

[NOTE]
If the person is already marked as a favourite, and the person attempts to mark it as a favourite, the command will throw an error. However, if the person is not a favourite and the user marks the person as not a favourite, the command will be successful.

[NOTE]
FavCommand is an UndoableCommand.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add new class `FavCommand()` +
**Pros:** Will have similar structure to other commands, and preserve consistency in implementation. +
**Cons:** Many new classes will have to be created to support this class, e.g. parsers, tests etc. +
**Alternative 2:** Just add a favourite tag alias` +
**Pros:** Little to no effort to implement. +
**Cons:** Future functionality based on the favourites list will be harder to implement.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Modifies a variable in the Person model. +
**Pros:** Automatically saved, easy to access data. +
**Cons:** Adds additional memory requirements to each Person model. +
**Alternative 2:** Add a tag called 'favourite' to target Person. +
**Pros:** No new classes needed, easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Difficult to build additional functionality based on favourites list.

---

**Aspect:** Make FavCommand() Undoable +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** FavCommand() is Undoable. +
**Pros:** Easy to quickly revert mistakes. +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** FavCommand() is not Undoable +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** Much longer command will need to be entered to revert any mistake.
// end::favCommand[]

// tag::liveHelp[]
=== Live Help
The live help feature aims to provide an alternative form of help window to the user. As the user types into the `CommandBox`, a possible list of commands with its usage is displayed in the `ResultDisplay`. +

This feature works by searching across all the commands to find possible commands that the user might be using. For example, typing `find` will result in the `ResultDisplay` showing help for `find`, `findtag` and `findemail` commands. +

The `liveHelp` method resides in `LogicManager` which retrieves the entered text from the `CommandBox` and passes the text into the `filterCommand` inside `AddressBookParser`. The `filterCommand` retrieves all possible commands that the user might be finding by checking if any `COMMAND_WORD` contains the entered word. The array of possible results is returned to the `liveHelp` method and is concatenated into a string which is displayed in the `ResultDisplay`.+
The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of the live help feature.

image::LiveHelpDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.8.1: Sequence Diagram for Live Help feature_

The `filterCommand` inside `AddressBookParser` employs the use of HashMap to store all the command words and the help for each command. This allows for a cleaner code as it removes the long if else statements by using a `for` loop to iterate through the entire list of commands.
----
for (HashMap.Entry<String, String> entry : commandList.entrySet()) {
    if (isExact) {
        if (entry.getKey().equals(array[0])) {
            result.add(entry.getKey());
        }
    } else {
        if (entry.getKey().contains(array[0])) {
            result.add(entry.getValue());
        }
    }
}
----
Furthermore, creating a boolean `isExact` allows for this method to also be used to check if a string is exactly a command word. +
By setting `isExact` to false, this method will return all command words that contains the entered text. +
By setting `isExact` to true, this method will return all command words that is equals to the entered text.
Hence, this reduces the need for another method.
----
public ArrayList<String> filterCommand(String text, boolean isExact) throws IllegalValueException {
    //Code
}
----

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Parsing the entered string +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store all the commands in a HashMap and iterate through the HashMap to compare each command word with the entered string. +
**Pros:** This implementation provides a cleaner code. Hence it is easier read and to add additional search functionality. For instance, only 1 if else is required to switch between finding if the command word is equals to the entered word or if the command contains the entered word +
**Cons:** None. +

**Alternative 2:** Use switch case statements to code the logic for each command. +
**Pros:** Straightforward. Easy to implement if there are only a few commands. +
**Cons:** Tedious and time consuming. Having additional conditions like `isExact` means having to duplicate the entire switch case. +

// end::liveHelp[]
=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/593/files[PR] for the full solution.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.

****

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594/files[PR] for the full solution.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
