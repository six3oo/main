`Justification`
--------------
`Find Email Command`: Some user may have very special email but their name may be difficult for a user to remember. +

For example, an English speaking user wants to collaborate with a Japanese YouTuber named Yukiko Ogawa, the name may be difficult for him to remember as Japanese is not be his/her native language. However, the Japanese YouTuber has the email catiscute@example.com, which is a lot easier for the user to remember.
 +
 +
 +
`Find Tag Command`: This makes the user's life easier as it brings out a list of YouTubers in the same genre range.
 +
 +
For example, a musician wants to collaborate with another musician to make music. However, his/her TABCC contact list +
has more than a 100 contacts. Rather than spending time looking at each contact, he/she could use the find tag command +
to look for all the musicians on his/her contact list.
 +
 +
 +
`Sort Command (ascending)`: Another command to make the user life easier.
 +
 +
For example, a user wants to look for his/her friend in the contact list, but the list is in order of when the user added the contact. +
He/she may spend a long time just to look for his friend's information. By sorting the name, the user would be
able to know exactly where the contact is located in the list.

`Enhancement Proposed: Collab Command`
-------------------------------------
==== Automatically send an pre-wrote email to a person in the contact list: `collab`. +
This command allows a user to automatically send a pre-crafted email to a person in the contact list. +
Format: `collab [contact's name]`. +
Example: +
****
* `collab pewdiepie`
* The email page will open and a message will already be crafted, user just need to click the send button.
* Sample email: Good day to you [contact's name], this is [user's name] and I would like to do a collaboration with you, +
please reply to this email if you are interested, thank you.
* Sample email can be edit by the user.
