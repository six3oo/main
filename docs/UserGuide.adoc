== Introduction
TABCC (The Address Book for Content Creators) is an address book application for YouTubers to store contact information of other YouTubers. TABCC makes those contact information accessible and easy to refer to. +
At the current stage of development, TABCC is only fully compatible with the Windows platform due to a lack of resources. However, the team may consider adding support for other platforms if enough users request for it.
